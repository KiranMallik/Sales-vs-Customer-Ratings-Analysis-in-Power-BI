- **Trend Analysis**: Identified trends over time to observe patterns in sales and ratings.

These techniques provided a solid foundation for our insights.

## üìä Visualizations

Visual representations play a key role in understanding data. This project features:

- **Bar Charts**: Display the relationship between average ratings and total sales.
- **Line Graphs**: Show trends over time for both metrics.
